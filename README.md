# Credit Risk Classification challenge
This repo documents my efforts against the TCC data analysis bootcamp's supervised learning homework challenge.

The challenge was to apply supervised learning ML techniques learned during week 20 to predict healthy loans based on typical credit worthiness standards. In other words, apply  ML to determine if the typical metrics are fair indicators of a person's likelihood to default on a loan.

## Structure
All substantive content resides in the Credit_Risk folder. The file structure is as follows:

- Credit_Risk
    - credit_risk_classification.ipynb
      - Jupyter notebook Python source code utilizing supervised ML techniques to predict credit worthiness of loan applicants based on typical applicant metrics
    - lending_data.csv
      - Source data provided by TCC
